# Currency Agent (A2A + ADK + MCP)

This repository contains a sample agent that showcases how to build a currency-conversion agent using the Agent Development Kit (ADK), the A2A Python SDK (Agent-to-Agent protocol), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
The agent can convert between different currencies by invoking a tool exposed via MCP, and is exposed as an A2A server so other agents/clients can call it.
